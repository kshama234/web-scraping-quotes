    "**[Quotes to Scrape](http://quotes.toscrape.com/)** is the website for the popular quotes by different authors related to different subjects. Who don't like to hear quotes?

    "## What is Web Scraping?\n",
    " Web Scraping is the process of extracting and parsing data from websites in an automated fashion using a computer program. There are many examples where web scraping can be useful, e.g. to create a job searching scraper, top movies scraper, mobile phone's price scraper and so on. Example, here we are extracting quotes. Web scraping involves extracting out information often from HTML documents and then convert into structured data like CSV file.\n",

    "* Install important libraries that will be helpful for the project i.e. requests, BeautifulSoup4, pandas.\n",
    "* Download the web page using the requests library\n",
    "* Inspecting HTML source code of the web page\n",
    "* Parsing parts of the website using Beautiful Soup\n",
    "* Convert parsing parts into csv file\n",
    "* Have a look on csv file using pandas library."
